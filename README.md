## Purpose
Citibike is thriving in NYC, and Des Moines wants to see if it would be a good investiment to bring the company to their city. 

## Overview
1. Import data into Tableau.
2. Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
3. Use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.
4. Portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.

## Results
- Of 2,344,224 Citibike users in NYC, approximately 19% are regular customers, and 81% are subscribers.
- 25% of those users are female, 65% are male, and 10% of unknown gender.
- Trips did not vary much by gender.  All genders were more likely to ride on weekends, with Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday afternoons a close second.
- Trip times did vary by subscriber/customer. Regular customers were more likely to ride on weekends, while subscribers rode the bikes most often on Thursday and Friday.

## Suggestions
In the future, consider analyzing how much money subscribers vs customers spend per ride, and break down subscribers/customers by gender to see how gender affects spending.
